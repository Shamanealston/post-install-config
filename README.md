The first step I did in this screenrecording was create a role called "Supreme Admin". Essentially, people assigned this role have no limitations when it comes to accessing, editing, assigning, etc. in this ticketing system. Secondly, I created a "System administrators" department. This department will be for all agents that are assigned the "supreme admin" role I created. Lastly, I created two teams; one being called "A team support" and the other being "Level ll suport". Hypothetically, the default team,  "level l support" could be for C tier tickets, "level ll support" could be for B tier tickets, and "A team support" could be for A tier tickets.
